## How to Use TiGGR

TiGGR is designed to be:
- **Fast** to learn
- **Flexible** across genres
- **Open** to hacking, reskinning, and storytelling chaos

Want to write your own scenario zines? Adapt the mechanics to a haunted gym franchise? Build a LARP about psychic corgis and space brunch? Go for it.

All we ask: credit the system. The preferred attribution is:

## Haven’t Pushed to GitHub in a While?

No worries—neither had we.  
If you’re getting SSH errors, [regenerate your SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh). It’s the classic dev re-entry ritual.
