# Contributing to TiGGR

Thanks for your interest in contributing to **TiGGR: A Tiny Game for Generalized Roleplaying**!

This system was built to be shared, remixed, and expanded. Whether you're fixing a typo, submitting a new scenario, or launching a full-on hack of the rules—we're excited to see what you do with it.

## How to Contribute

### 🛠 Fix Something
See a typo? Spot an unclear sentence? Want to improve formatting?

### 🌀 Submit a Hack or Variant

Created a new version of TiGGR with a twist—like psychic duels, bureaucratic fantasy, or fungal space exploration?

- Add your variant to the `/hacks/` folder  
- Include a `README.md` that explains how your version riffs on the original
- Credit yourself and include the same CC BY 4.0 license (unless you’re changing it—let us know if you are)

We’re especially excited to highlight hacks that expand the *TiGGRverse* in bold or strange directions.

### 🗺 Submit a Microsetting

Got a one-page scenario or starting point?

- Add it to the `/examples/` folder  
- Use Markdown formatting if possible
- Follow the microsetting builder from the SRD (Genre, Scene, Goal, Factions, Hooks, Gear, Vehicle [optional])

If you’re unsure, check out the `grocery-gauntlet.md` example for structure.
