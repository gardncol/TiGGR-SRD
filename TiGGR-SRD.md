### 1. **Core Concepts**
- **Players:** 2–5 (1 GM, 1–4 players)  
- **Playtime:** 30–45 minutes  
- **Dice:** 2d6  
- **Stats:**  
  - **Body** – strength, agility, physical action  
  - **Mind** – knowledge, intuition, cleverness  
  - **Charm** – charisma, persuasion, presence

---

### 2. **Character Creation**
- **Distribute 3 points** across Body, Mind, and Charm (e.g., 2/1/0 or 1/1/1).  
- **Choose a Role** (e.g., Hacker, Rocker, Lady, Pilot).  
- **Create a Special Ability**: +1 bonus in specific contexts or a once-per-scene narrative effect.  
- **Pick Signature Gear**: Use once per scenario for a +3 bonus to a roll or damage.  
- **Start with 5 HP**. At 0 HP, you’re knocked out—return next scene.

---

### 3. **Vehicle Creation** *(Optional)*
- **Assign 3 stat points** (Body/Mind/Charm).  
- **10 HP total.**  
- **1 Gear item**, usable once per scene (e.g., Cannon, Cloaking Fan).  
- Regular weapons deal 0 damage unless called out as “heavy.”

---

### 4. **Core Mechanics**
- **Roll = 2d6 + Stat vs. Difficulty**  
  - Easy: 6 | Medium: 8 | Hard: 10  
- **Combat:**  
  - To Hit = 2d6 + Body vs. 8  
  - Damage = 1d6 + Gear/Ability bonuses  
  - Defense Roll (PCs only): 2d6 + Body vs. 8  
  - Goons: 1–3 HP, no defense rolls  
  - Vehicles: 10 HP  
- **Special Abilities**: Once per scene  
- **Gear**: Once per scenario  
- **No roll needed for safe/routine actions**

---

### 5. **Gameplay Loop**
1. Pick a genre & set the scene.  
2. Create characters (and vehicles if needed).  
3. Establish a clear goal.  
4. Players act in turn: **Move, then Act** (talk, attack, etc.).  
5. GM reacts, narrates, escalates.  
6. Scenario ends when goal is reached—or the party wipes.

---

### 6. **Progression: No XP, Just Vibes**
- After a major moment, **shift 1 stat point** (group consensus).  
- **Evolve Special Abilities** to match character growth.  
- All changes are narrative—no tallying or level-ups.

---

### 7. **Microsetting Builder**
1. **Pick a Genre** (fantasy, noir, sci-fi western, etc.)  
2. **Set the Scene** – one vivid location  
3. **Define a Goal** – what must be done  
4. **Create Factions** – 2 groups with 1–3 HP and 1 Gear each  
5. **Add Hooks** – 2 twisty elements with target Difficulties (6–8)  
6. **Optional Gear** – 1 standout item (+3 bonus, 1 use)  
7. **Optional Vehicle** – 3 stats, 10 HP, 1 Gear item

---

### 8. **GM Tips**
- Default Difficulty: 8 if uncertain  
- Only roll for risky actions  
- Use narration to reward boldness  
- Vehicles = power fantasy, but they *can* break  
- Ask weird questions: “What’s the ghost barista’s unfinished business?” “What’s a smuggler hiding in the vending machine?”
